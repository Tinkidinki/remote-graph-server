# Remote Graph Server

## Problem Statement
Write Java Server and Client programs that satisfy the following functionality. The server maintains a database of graphs and contains a function that returns the weight of the minimum spanning tree that the client interacts with using the following commands:
`add_graph <graph_id>` - Adds a graph to the server
`add_edge <graph_id> <u> <v> <w>` - Adds an edge to the graph
`get_mst <graph_id>` - returns weight of minimum weight spanning tree

## Architecture
To accomplish this, we use Java's Remote Method Interface. 
An interface in Java is like a declaration of a class. Only when a class `implements` it does it becomes real.
